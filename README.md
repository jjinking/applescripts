# Increase work flow efficiency/productivity with AppleScripts

- Used Script Editor to edit AppleScript and saved as text (.applescript code files)
- Used Automator to create a service that runs an AppleScript with no input
- Added keyboard shortcut in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services -> General
- Added my most commonly used programs/apps to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility control list
